# PANOSE Parameter 5: Contrast

By "contrast", we mean the difference between the widths of thick and thin strokes.

0: any contrast  
1: no fit  
2: no contrast  
3: very low    
4: low   
5: medium low  
6: medium   
7: medium high   
8: high   
9: very high   


Contrast is measured from the single letter 'O' of a given font:    


If a and b are the maximum widths (calculated perpendicularly to the stroke's "midline") and c and d are the minimum widths, then the contrast κ is equal to .  


The continuous parameter's values are grouped into classes according to the thresholds below:

2: no contrast, if κ > 0.8    
3: very low, if 0.65 < κ ≤ 0.8   
4: low, if 0.48 < κ ≤ 0.65    
5: medium low, if 0.3 < κ ≤ 0.48   
6: medium, if 0.2 < κ ≤ 0.3     
7: medium high, if 0.15 < κ ≤ 0.2  
8: high, if 0.08 < κ ≤ 0.15   
9: very high, if κ ≤ 0.08
